'''Integers and Floats
When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a 
whole number, you’ll always get a float'''

print(4/2)

''' Underscores in Numbers
When you’re writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscores 
to make large numbers more readable: '''

universe_age = 14_000_000_000
print(universe_age)

# Multiple Assignment
x, y, z = 3,6,87

# Constants
''' Python doesn’t have built-in constant types, but Python programmers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed: '''

MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000
