# Python List Assignment is by Reference (Not Copy)
# In Python, variables that hold lists donâ€™t store the list itself, but a reference (or pointer) to the memory location where the list is stored.

# When you assign a list to another variable, you are not creating a new list; instead, you are creating a new reference to the same list in memory.
# my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
# At this point:

# my_foods holds a reference to the actual list ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
