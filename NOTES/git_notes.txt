1. Make sure the commit author is actually you (your GitHub account).
    git log --pretty=full

2. This shows all commits made since 12:00 AM today in the current repository.
    git log --since=midnight --oneline

3. To get just the number:
    git rev-list --count HEAD --since=midnight

4. This keeps your changes (rename + new files), but removes them from the staging area.
    git reset
    

                    struggling is a part of growth.
                    You’re not supposed to know everything — but you're supposed to try.
